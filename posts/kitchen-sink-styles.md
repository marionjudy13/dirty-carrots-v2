# Kitchen Sink CSS Styles

## The Goal:

Today I'm going to spend a little bit of time setting up my CSS styles, hopefully covering everything I would use in a typical blog post so that I don't have to worry about styling when I'm working on other coding challenges and topics. 

## The Plan:

I've copied over HTML5 Kitchen Sink from [this Github Repo](https://github.com/dbox/html5-kitchen-sink) (thanks @dbox!), I'll copy it into this file, and will add my own css via React CSS Modules!

## The Kitchen Sink:
**First Attempt (No Blog Styles Added):**

### Problem #1

Well, I certainly didn't think this through.  Obviously I can't just copy raw HTML into a markdown file (I mean, I *did* and it obviously didn't work).  SO, now to make a kitchen sink PAGE I can refer to while styling, and then I will build a post using markdown syntax.  At least now I can see what didn't work, and the main styles needed for the blog header and metadata.
